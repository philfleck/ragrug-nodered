Adds nodes for Node-RED that interact with IATK on the RagRug client. Many of the included nodes do not have server-side code and are only executed on the RagRug client.

There are several examples available that can be imported into Node-RED directly by selecting Import > Examples > @ragrug/ragrug-nodered in the Node-RED menu.
